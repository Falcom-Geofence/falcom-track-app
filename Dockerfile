# Build the Flutter mobile application inside a container.
# This file uses the official Cirrus Labs Flutter image to ensure that
# Android and iOS toolchains are installed.  On build the container
# generates a fresh Flutter project if platform directories are missing,
# installs dependencies, and then builds both Android and iOS artefacts.
